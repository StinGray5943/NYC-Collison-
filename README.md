# NYC-Collison
 ## Introduction
 This document provides an in-depth analysis of traffic accidents in New York City using data from NYC Open Data. The study examines accident trends over time, identifies key contributing factors, and highlights high-risk locations.
## Project Requirements
The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:
1.What is the percentage of total accidents by month, and do any seasonal patterns emerge?
2.How does accident frequency vary by day of the week and time of day?
3.Which street has the highest number of accidents, and what percentage does it represent?
4.What are the most common contributing factors for all accidents and fatal accidents specifically?
 ## Data Overview
- **Source**: NYC Open Data
- **File Type**: CSV
- **Number of Records**: 238,421
- **Number of Fields**: 18
- **Data Structure**: Single dataset
 ## Process and Tools Used
### 1.Data Cleaning
- The dataset was cleaned using **Excel**, which included removing duplicate records, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
### 2. Data Analysis
- Pivot tables and formulas in **Excel** were used to compute accident frequencies by month, day, time, and location.
- Statistical calculations helped identify trends and patterns.
### 3. Data Visualization
- Excel charts and graphs, such as **bar charts** and **line graphs**, were used to visually represent accident distributions and trends.
##  Analysis and Results
### Monthly Accident Trends
- The analysis of monthly accident rates indicates that **March** has the highest percentage of accidents, accounting for **10.53%** of total recorded incidents.
- The data suggests potential seasonal patterns, although further statistical analysis may be required to confirm trends across years.
### Accident Frequency by Day and Time
- **Fridays** record the highest number of accidents, with peak occurrences between **4:00 PM and 5:00 PM**.
- The findings align with peak traffic hours, highlighting potential congestion-related risk factors.
###  High-Risk Locations
- **Belt Parkway** has recorded the highest number of accidents.
- The percentage of accidents occurring on this road relative to total incidents needs further calculation but is identified as a significant hotspot.
###  Contributing Factors
- The leading cause of accidents is **driver carelessness** and **lack of attention**.
-For fatal accidents, the primary cause remains **unspecified**, suggesting a need for further data refinement or classification.
 ## Conclusion and Recommendations
- **High-Risk Periods**: Enhanced traffic monitoring and enforcement during **Friday** peak hours may reduce accident frequency.
- **High-Risk Locations**: Improved road safety measures on **Belt Parkway** should be considered.
- **Data Improvements**: Additional classification for fatal accidents may help in policy development.
## Future Scope
- Extending the analysis to include multiple years for trend verification.
- Identifying correlations with weather conditions, traffic volume, and road conditions.
- Implementing predictive modeling to forecast accident-prone periods and locations.
